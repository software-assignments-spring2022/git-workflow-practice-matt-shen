[How facial recognition is taking over airports](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/airports-facial-recognition/index.html)

## Analysis
This article touched upon biometric software and its integration into everyday travel. The reporter, taking a jetblue flight, was suprised as she did not need to present any form of identification (i.e. passport, boarding pass, etc.) Instead, facial recognition was used as a means of identification in this international flight. When tweeting about this, JetBlue responded saying "You're able to opt out of this procedure, MacKenzie. Sorry if this made you feel uncomfortable," thereby confirming the use of facial recognition as a valid method of identification in traveling. This seems almost inevitable, as technology has begun to creep its way into everyday life. Means such as facial identification and fingerprint identificaiton have been used on cell phones for some time now, so it doesn't come as a surprise that these technologies have begun to overtake archaic paper identification. 

### Comments
Amanda Qiu: The use of facial recognition as a method of identification may be unsettling to people at first but technology is advancing quickly and it is making these processes faster.
